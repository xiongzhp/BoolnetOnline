Online boolean network Simulator for demo use
======================================

This webapp allows the user to load Boolean networks in various formats,
display and interactively simulate them, it's only for demo use now, since I iterates the model using the synchronous state updating method, which is not quite proper for most cases. For getting use of updating method like general asynchronous and random order asynchronous, please refer to https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet.

Have fun!
